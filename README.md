# Car-Gallery

This web application is built with Vite, a fast build tool, and React for the dynamic user interface. To create immersive 3D visuals, I integrated Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library that leverages WebGL for rendering. The user can navigate the gallery using OrbitControls to get a 360 degree view of some of their favourite cars.

The Car Gallery showcases various car models with interactive 3D views, allowing users to rotate and zoom in on the cars from different angles. To optimize loading times, I implemented Suspense and Preload from @react-three/drei, ensuring smooth loading and rendering of the 3D assets.

The project also includes tailwindcss and media queries to detect and adjust the user experience based on device screen size. This ensures that users on both desktops and mobile devices can enjoy a seamless and captivating car browsing experience.
